# Terraform -> VM + Ansible + Jenkins
This Tutorial is going to show you how we can fully automate jenkins installation in our environment.
I have written a Terraform code to:
1st: Provision a VM in ESXi (Ubuntu)
2nd: Install and configure jenkins using Ansible
NOTE: All this is done using one Terraform code.
